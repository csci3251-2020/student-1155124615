## Intro

Hi. It's lucky to meet you here, when I doubt lots of people would actually click on others' profiles and have a sneak peek.

I'm ~~Cortana~~ Nux, a year 2 CS-major-COMM-minor student from Morningside College. So far I still have a final paper to finish up - so I won't write a lot here. However, if you're interested in knowing more about me or making another friend amid mankind, feel free to send over a message via Telegram `@makerx`, or find me on Facebook.

Below is some personal info that I can momentarily think of. We're on a life-long journey of self-discovery, anyways.

## My Interests

Category | Description
-------- | -----------
Listening | Indie/Alternative, Contemporary Folk, sometimes Easy Listening.
Reading | Modern Chinese history, Political Theory, Communication Theory, and Philosophy.
Watching | Miscellaneous. Got hooked on _Better Call Saul_ recently.
Playing | Trying to get rid of. Mainly CSGO/Fortnite, with Resident Evil when 2 bored.

## Labeling Myself

I hate to do this - I bet you feel the same way, but we have to learn Markdown.

- [x] Good thinker of abstract ideas
- [x] More often a Dreamer than Do-er
- [x] Liberal but not radical
- [x] Leftist with sanity
- [ ] Money-minded career-seeking student
- [ ] Ready to get ripped off as a software engineer

## Summer Plan

* Output some trash in the summer research internship
* Work on the self-founded project team
* Catch up with the reading list
* Practice electric guitar
* Not die from corona

Ok it turned out I actually didn't write too little. As a conclusion (if you happened to read until here), you may wonder what the aforementioned "project team" is - no more secrets, it's an entrepreneurship team of 6 students dedicated to creating a social media platform for university students. We're looking for new members - if you consider yourself as having good product design or graphics design skills, please don't hesitate to contact me. We can work out wonders.

That's all for this page. Good luck for your finals.
